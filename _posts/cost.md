# Cost of Cubesat
![alt cubesat]( https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/15-168_cubesats_image_2.jpg)

[CubeSat](http://www.cubesat.org/) forms a cost-effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit.After delays from low-cost launchers such as Interorbital Systems, launch prices have been about $100,000 per unit, but newer operators are offering lower pricing.

Some CubeSats have complicated components or instruments, such as LightSail-1, that pushes their construction cost into the millions,but a basic 1U CubeSat can cost about $50,000 to construct so CubeSats are a viable option for some schools and universities; as well as small businesses to develop CubeSats for commercial purposes.Various NASA and International Space Station projects accept some proposals using the CubeSat architecture. There are more companies entering the private launch business each year, so prospects for getting a launch are becoming more robust.
